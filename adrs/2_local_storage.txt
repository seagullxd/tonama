Decision outcome: Approved

Document to investigate the appropriate means of browser storage. The aim is to keep data storage simple. 

What is the reason for the decision being raised?
- To decide how to handle a player's data
	* levels completed & in-progress, in-progress levels (country guesses & hints used), daily games streak, total points

What is a suitable approach?
- Local storage
	* persistent data
	* light storage - up to 5-10mb of data per domain
	* stores data as simple key-value pair
	* key-value storage
	* accessible via JavaScript
	* not sent to the server 

What else was considered?
- Session storage
	* temporary storage
	* storage limit - up to 5-10mb of data per domain
	* key-value storage 
	* not sent to the server — Only accessible via the browser
- Cookies
	* limited Storage — 4KB per cookie
	* data sent to the server — included in every HTTP request
	* can have expiry dates — persistent or session-based cookies
	* supports secure storage

What are some considerations?
- You may need to consider a db solution in future
- Local storage is accessible through JavaScript running in the browser
	* Data stored here is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
	* Attacker can inject client-side scripts, such as JavaScript, into a web app in order to gain access to sensitive information.
- Cookies are better suited for storing sensitive data than localStorage or sessionStorage
